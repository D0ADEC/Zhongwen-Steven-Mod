I made this modded version because I just prefer Zhuyin over Pinyin, and my goals for Mandarin fit more around Guoyu Mandarin and the use of a Bopomofo keyboard - thus Pinyin is rather irrelavent to me - and I couldn't find a way to remove it from the original version.

You will need to enable Zhuyin in the options page, to get to this press
